# Sample Style Guide
## Technical Writing Academy - May 2021
<br>

## **Bold** <br>
Use bold to highlight button names, fields names, menus, radio buttons, or checkboxes. For example:
* Click the **Create** button to start the process.
* Enter your IP address in the **IP Address** field.
<br>
## **Italics** <br>
Use italics to emphasize a word or group of words. 
For example: 
* *At least* two reviews are required before your check in your code. <br>
* You must *not* enter without your ID card. <br>

**IMPORTANT**: Use this style sparingly to avoid diluting its strenght.
<br>
## **Fixed Font** <br> 
Use a fixed font to highlight:
* **Commands or pieces of code.** For example: Run the `nmp install text-cli` command to install the utility.
* File or folder names. For example: Read the `README .md` file before you proceed.
<br>
## **Abbreviations** <br>
Never use the following abbreviations in a formal document:
* e.g. - Instead use "for example".
* i.e. - Instead use "in other words".
* etc. - Instead give the full list of options
* fig. - Instead spell it out as "figure".
* pg. - Instead spell it out as "page".
<br>
## **Capitalization** <br>
Use standard capitalization rules. Also, keep in mind the following:
The first word after a colon (:) is always capitalized.
Every heading, table caption, figure caption, column name, or a callout in a figure or table must be in title case.
<br>
## **Acronyms** <br>
Always define an acronym when you are using it for the first time. <br>
For example: This section specifies the terms used in a Product Requirement Document (PRD). The most often temrs in a PRD include...
<br>
## **Commas in Lists** <br>
The rules regarding commas for in-sentence lists are as follows:
* Do not use a comma before "and" and "or" if your list contains *only two items.* For example: Any new organization needs to invest in good infrastructure and hiring great talent.
* Use a comma before "and" and "or" when your list comprises *three or more items.* For example: A "Pod" comprises a Project Manager, a Technical Writer, Engineers, and UX designers.
<br>
## **Numbers**<br>
Rember these rules about numbers:
* Spell out numbers that are less than 10 (0-9). For example: I have seven aunts.
* Use numerals for 10 and higher. For example: This hub has 32 ports.
* Use a comma to make it easier to read numbers higher than 999. For example: The network supports up to 10,000 connections.
<br>
## **Contractions**<br>
Contractions are considered informal writing. To prevent "stuffiness2 use the contraction "don't".
Avoid other contractions such as "it's" or "doesn't".
<br>
## **Apostrophes**<br>
Do not use an apostrophe for the plural of acronyms. For example: 
* API's - Instead use APIs.
* LAN's - Instead use LANs.
